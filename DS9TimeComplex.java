Types of notations 
1. O-notation: It is used to denote asymptotic upper bound. For a given function g(n), we denote it by O(g(n)). Pronounced as
“big-oh of g of n”. It is also known as worst case time complexity as it denotes the upper bound in which the algorithm terminates. 

2. Ω-notation: It is used to denote asymptotic lower bound. For a given function g(n), we denote it by Ω(g(n)). Pronounced as “big-omega
of g of n”. It is also known as best case time complexity as it denotes the lower bound in which the algorithm terminates. 

3. 𝚯-notation: It is used to denote the average time of a program.


It follows the following order in case of time complexity: 
O(nn) > O(n!) > O(n3) > O(n2) > O(n.log(n)) > O(n.log(log(n))) > O(n) > O(sqrt(n)) > O(log(n)) > O(1) 

Note: Reverse is the order for better performance of a code with corresponding time complexity, i.e. a program with less time complexity is more efficient.
